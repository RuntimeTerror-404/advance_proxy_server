Here’s a **summary** of your **Advanced Proxy Server** project, including its **objectives**, **tools/tech stack**, and **features** to make it a robust, advanced-level backend project.

### **Project Title**: Advanced Proxy Server with Reverse Proxy and Security Features

---

### **Project Objectives**:
1. **Reverse Proxy Functionality**: Develop a reverse proxy server that routes client requests to backend services based on specific rules (e.g., load balancing, request headers, etc.). The proxy should support dynamic configuration to adapt to traffic and user needs.
   
2. **Advanced Security Features**:
   - Implement SSL/TLS termination to ensure secure traffic between clients and the proxy server.
   - Add JWT-based authentication and authorization for API security.
   - Integrate Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection).
   - Implement IP whitelisting/blacklisting and Geo-blocking to control access.
   - Add API rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
   - Include security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options) and intrusion detection mechanisms.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) to efficiently distribute traffic across backend services.
   - Use Redis for advanced caching of frequently accessed resources and user sessions.
   
4. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Integrate real-time logging and monitoring using Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Kibana for proxy traffic analytics and attack detection.
   - Set up honeypot integration to capture and analyze potential attacks.

5. **Scalability & Flexibility**: Design the system to handle high concurrency and large traffic volumes with minimal latency. It should support dynamic reverse proxy configurations without downtime.

### **Tech Stack and Tools**:

1. **Java Spring Boot**:
   - The core framework for building the proxy server with features like security, REST APIs, and reverse proxy.
   - **Spring Cloud Gateway** for advanced routing and reverse proxy functionalities.

2. **Kafka**:
   - For real-time logging, monitoring, and streaming of proxy request data.
   - Can also be used to queue requests in case of high traffic or failover scenarios.

3. **Elasticsearch and Kibana**:
   - Store and visualize proxy logs, request data, and traffic patterns for real-time monitoring and intrusion detection.
   - Kibana dashboards for analyzing logs and triggering alerts.

4. **Redis**:
   - Used for caching frequently accessed resources and storing session data.
   - Can also be used to handle rate limiting by tracking API usage per user or IP.

5. **AWS (Free Tier)**:
   - **EC2** for deploying the proxy server and backend services.
   - **S3** for logging and possible storage of some resources.
   - **CloudWatch** for monitoring performance metrics and setting up alerts.

6. **Let’s Encrypt**:
   - For generating and managing SSL/TLS certificates to secure communication between clients and the proxy server.

7. **Spring Security**:
   - To implement security features like JWT authentication, API rate limiting, and role-based access control (RBAC).
   - Integration with **OAuth 2.0** for secure API authentication.

8. **NGINX** (Optional):
   - You can use NGINX as a supplementary reverse proxy for performance comparisons and SSL termination if needed.

9. **GeoIP**:
   - For IP filtering and geo-blocking based on the origin of client requests.

10. **Honeypot Integration**:
    - A simple decoy service to capture and analyze malicious requests, enhancing the server's security posture.

### **Summary of Project Features**:
1. **Reverse Proxy** with advanced routing rules (load balancing, session affinity, dynamic rules).
2. **SSL/TLS Encryption** to secure all client-proxy communications.
3. **JWT-based Authentication and Authorization** to control access to backend services.
4. **API Rate Limiting and Throttling** to prevent abuse.
5. **IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting** and **Geo-blocking** to control access from specific regions or IP addresses.
6. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for protection against web-based attacks.
7. **Real-time Logging and Monitoring** using **Kafka** and **Elasticsearch/Kibana**.
8. **Intrusion Detection** and **Honeypot** setup for malicious request handling.
9. **Dynamic Proxy Configuration** allowing for real-time changes in routing policies without service downtime.
